# Image Histogram Processing
<p>This project focuses on enhancing and analyzing images through various histogram-based techniques. The program takes an image as input, computes the histogram of the color channels (Red, Green, and Blue), and applies different processing techniques to improve contrast and balance in the image.
<br><br><b>Key Features:</b><br><br>
<b>1. Histogram Computation:</b><br>
For each color channel (Red, Green, and Blue), the program computes and displays the histogram, showing the distribution of pixel intensity values.<br><br>
  
<b>2. Aggressive Stretching: </b><br>
A more aggressive form of contrast stretching that enhances image contrast further by extending the histogram range more significantly, leading to more pronounced changes in the image.<br><br>

<b>3. Histogram Equalization:</b><br>
This method redistributes the intensity values of the image to achieve a more balanced histogram, improving overall contrast, particularly in images with poor lighting.<br><br>

<b>Goals of the Project:</b><br><br>
To demonstrate various image processing techniques for contrast enhancement.<br>
<br>To provide visual comparisons between different histogram-based methods for improving image quality.
<br><br><b>Supporting Files (optional):</b>
<br><br>Provided a sample image "baboon.png" to work with the program. The picture needs to be downloaded in the directory the program will be working on.
